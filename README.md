# dijkstra-algorithm

### Quick Overview
Python project to use queues to create a **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest path in a graph, I did a similar project for one of my classes, wanted to try to make my own graph class and create an algorithm from there.

------------------------

### Files in this project:
* dijkstra.py : This file has the function `dijkAlgâ€Ž(start:str, end:str, g: Graph)` that takes an object `Graph`, and two existing vertices and finds the shortest path between them (also have an example graph using the function)

* graphObj.py : This contains the class `Graph` that creates a graph object with some basic features - vertices, edges, and the weight on edges


Some helpful links I used for making this:
* [Dijkstra Algorithm explaination](https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/)
* [Existing graph class](https://gist.github.com/IranNeto/f1ac6af73963576e3efe3ec94d94cbe5 ) _I created kind of the same thing, w/ some adjustments_
